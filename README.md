Community Contribution Video Tutorial for STATGR5702 (Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization).

Notes
- Unfortunately, the first file I used in my code was too large to upload on GitHub, but the data can be found here: https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search
- Additionally, the chlorophyll-a visualization does not show up in this pdf for whatever reason, but when the R markdown file is knit, it does show up
